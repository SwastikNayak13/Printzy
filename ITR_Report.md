## CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

---

### 2.1 Android Development Overview

Android is a mobile operating system based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android development has evolved significantly over the years, with modern development practices focusing on:

**Key Android Development Concepts:**

- **Kotlin as Primary Language**: Google officially supports Kotlin as the preferred language for Android development since 2017.
- **Modern UI Frameworks**: Jetpack Compose represents the future of Android UI development, replacing traditional XML-based layouts.
- **Architecture Components**: Google provides a comprehensive set of libraries for building robust, testable, and maintainable applications.

**Android Architecture Components:**

The Android architecture consists of several layers:
- **Application Layer**: Contains the user interface and application logic
- **Application Framework**: Provides high-level services to applications
- **Android Runtime**: Executes application code
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer**: Provides standard interfaces to hardware
- **Linux Kernel**: Manages system resources

### 2.2 Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

**Key Features of Jetpack Compose:**

1. **Declarative UI**: Compose uses a declarative approach where you describe what the UI should look like, and Compose handles the rest.

2. **Composable Functions**: UI components are built using composable functions that can be easily combined and reused.

3. **State Management**: Compose provides built-in state management capabilities that automatically update the UI when state changes.

4. **Material Design**: Full support for Material Design 3 with customizable components.

5. **Performance**: Compose is optimized for performance with intelligent recomposition.

**Compose Lifecycle:**

The Compose lifecycle consists of three main phases:
- **Composition**: Creating a tree of UI components
- **Layout**: Measuring and positioning components
- **Drawing**: Rendering components on screen

### 2.3 MVVM Architecture

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is an architectural pattern that separates the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic or back-end logic.

**Components of MVVM:**

1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application
2. **View**: Represents the UI components and user interactions
3. **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between Model and View, handling presentation logic

**Benefits of MVVM:**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI and business logic
- **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and modify code
- **Reusability**: ViewModels can be reused across different Views
