# Printzy Android Application - Project Report

## Executive Summary

**Printzy** is a modern Android print-on-demand application built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app provides a streamlined 5-step workflow for users to order custom print jobs for books and documents. This project demonstrates proficiency in modern Android development practices, including declarative UI design, state management, and navigation architecture.

## Project Overview

### Application Details
- **Package Name**: `com.example.printzy`
- **Target SDK**: 34
- **Minimum SDK**: 26
- **Version**: 1.0 (Build 1)
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose

### Core Features
1. **Multi-Step Ordering Process**: 5-screen guided workflow
2. **Dynamic UI**: Context-aware interface that adapts based on user selections
3. **State Management**: Persistent data across navigation using ViewModel
4. **Modern UI Design**: Material Design 3 components with custom styling
5. **Navigation Architecture**: Jetpack Compose Navigation for seamless screen transitions

## Technical Architecture

### Architecture Pattern
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Single Activity Architecture**: All screens managed through Compose Navigation
- **State Management**: ViewModel with mutable state for data persistence

### Key Components

#### 1. MainActivity.kt
- Entry point of the application
- Sets up the Compose theme and navigation
- Instantiates the shared OrderViewModel
- Configures the NavHost with 5 destinations

#### 2. OrderViewModel.kt
- Manages application state using `mutableStateOf`
- Contains `PrintOrder` data class for order information
- Provides methods for updating order details:
  - `setJobType()`: Sets the print job type (Book/Document)
  - `setOptions()`: Updates all print configuration options

#### 3. Screen Components
- **GettingStartedScreen**: Job type selection (Book/Document)
- **OptionsScreen**: Print configuration options
- **UploadScreen**: File upload interface
- **SummaryScreen**: Order review and shipping details
- **ConfirmationScreen**: Order completion confirmation

## User Interface Analysis

### Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Custom blue theme (#007BFF) with Material Design 3
- **Typography**: Material Design 3 typography system
- **Layout**: Responsive design with proper spacing and alignment
- **Components**: Custom reusable components (JobTypeButton, SelectableButton, etc.)

### Screen Flow Analysis

#### Screen 1: Getting Started
- Clean, centered layout with app branding
- Two primary action buttons for job type selection
- Icon-based visual cues (Book and Document icons)
- Immediate navigation to options screen

#### Screen 2: Options Configuration
- Dynamic UI that shows/hides options based on job type
- Book-specific options: Cover type, Book size
- Universal options: Print option, Color, Orientation
- Interactive selection buttons with visual feedback

#### Screen 3: File Upload
- Displays selected print options summary
- Context-aware file upload areas:
  - Books: Separate cover and content upload areas
  - Documents: Single upload area
- Dashed border design for upload zones

#### Screen 4: Order Summary
- Two-column layout: Order details and Shipping form
- Comprehensive order summary with pricing
- Complete shipping address form
- Order total calculation display

#### Screen 5: Confirmation
- Success confirmation with green accent color
- Clear messaging about order processing
- Navigation back to start screen

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Modern Android Development**: Uses latest Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3
2. **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured MVVM pattern implementation
3. **Reusable Components**: Custom composables for consistent UI
4. **State Management**: Proper use of ViewModel for data persistence
5. **Navigation**: Clean navigation setup with type-safe routing
6. **Preview Support**: All screens have @Preview composables for development

### Areas for Improvement
1. **File Upload Functionality**: Currently placeholder implementation
2. **Form Validation**: No input validation on shipping form
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling throughout the app
4. **Testing**: No unit or UI tests implemented
5. **Accessibility**: Missing accessibility labels and support
6. **Internationalization**: Hardcoded strings, no i18n support
